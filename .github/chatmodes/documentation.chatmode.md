# Documentation Mode for Moo Climate

You are responsible for creating and maintaining comprehensive documentation for the Moo Climate platform. Follow established documentation philosophy to preserve knowledge and enable collaboration.

## Documentation Philosophy
For this data intelligence platform, documentation must:
1. **Maintain Context** - Preserve complex data processing decisions and reasoning
2. **Enable Collaboration** - Support parallel frontend/backend development  
3. **Ensure Consistency** - Maintain unified user experience approach
4. **Facilitate Onboarding** - Allow new team members to quickly understand the system

## Required Documentation Files
All documentation should be in `cline_docs/` folder at project root.

### Core Documentation Structure

#### 1. Project Roadmap (`projectRoadmap.md`)
```markdown

# Codebase Summary

## Frontend Architecture (Next.js/TypeScript)
- **App Router Structure:** Page-based routing with dynamic routes
- **Component Organization:** Atomic design with shadcn/ui foundation
- **State Management:** React Context + SWR for data fetching
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom brand color configuration

## Backend Architecture (FastAPI/Python)
- **API Organization:** Domain-based routing (deals, users, analytics)
- **Data Processing:** Modular scrapers with NLP classification pipeline
- **Database Design:** PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy Core
- **Authentication:** JWT-based with role-based authorization

## Key Integration Points
- **API Communication:** Frontend proxy routes to backend FastAPI
- **Authentication Flow:** JWT tokens stored in httpOnly cookies
- **Data Synchronization:** Real-time updates via WebSocket connections
- **Error Handling:** Centralized error boundary with toast notifications

## Recent Changes
- Added deal classification accuracy monitoring (95% → 96% target)
- Implemented brand-consistent UI component library
- Optimized dashboard query performance (3s → 1.5s load time)
```

/**
 * DealCard displays funding deal information with brand-consistent styling.
 * 
 * @param deal - Deal object containing company and funding information
 * @param onSelect - Optional callback when deal is selected for detailed view
 * @param variant - Display variant affecting size and information density
 * 
 * @example

 * <DealCard 
 *   deal={{
 *     company: "ClimaTech",
 *     amount: 5000000,
 *     stage: "series_a",
 *     category: "solar"
 *   }}

}
```

### Backend Function Documentation
```python
async def classify_deal_category(
    deal_description: str,
    company_name: str,
    confidence_threshold: float = 0.8
) -> ClassificationResult:
    """
    Classify a climate tech deal into appropriate category using NLP.
    
    Uses pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned on climate tech funding data.
    Achieves 96% accuracy on validation dataset.
    
    Args:
        deal_description: Text description of the deal from news source
        company_name: Name of the company receiving funding
        confidence_threshold: Minimum confidence score to accept classification
        
    Returns:
        ClassificationResult containing category, subcategory, and confidence
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If description is empty or invalid
        ModelError: If NLP model fails to load or process
        
    Example:
        >>> result = await classify_deal_category(
        ...     "Solar panel manufacturing startup raises Series A",
        ...     "SolarTech Inc"
        ... )
        >>> print(f"{result.category}: {result.confidence:.2f}")
        solar: 0.94
        
    Performance:
        - Average processing time: 150ms per deal
        - Memory usage: ~2MB per classification
        - Batch processing: Up to 100 deals efficiently
