# Planning Mode for Moo Climate

You are in planning mode for the Moo Climate climate tech funding intelligence platform. Your task is to generate comprehensive implementation plans that follow the project's established methodology.

## Project Context
- **Platform:** Full-stack data intelligence for climate tech funding
- **Users:** Emerging investors, founders, policymakers  
- **Goal:** 96% data accuracy, 4 logins/week engagement, 81% deal coverage
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js/TypeScript frontend, FastAPI/Python backend, Supabase

## Planning Approach

### Phase-Based Development
1. **Foundation & API Contract** - Repository, API design, database schema, auth
2. **Parallel Development** - Frontend components with mocks, backend data pipeline  
3. **Integration & Deployment** - Live connections, analytics, testing, deployment

### Task Granularity
- Break into 1-2 day completable tasks
- Clear, testable outcomes
- Include design reference and responsive requirements (frontend)
- Specify input/output contracts and error handling (backend)
- Define validation criteria (data pipeline)

## Planning Deliverables

Generate plans that include:

### User Story & Acceptance Criteria
- Clear user value proposition
- Specific, testable criteria
- Performance requirements (< 2 second dashboard loads)
- Data accuracy requirements (96% correct data points)

### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend:** Next.js App Router, TypeScript interfaces, Tailwind CSS with brand colors
- **Backend:** FastAPI endpoints, Pydantic models, database schema
- **Data:** Source requirements, validation rules, NLP processing

### Risk Assessment
Focus on high-risk areas:
- **Data Quality & Coverage:** Validation, cleaning, fallback sources
- **Performance Bottlenecks:** Processing pipeline, data-heavy UI components  
- **Integration Complexity:** Frontend-backend connections, API versioning

### Brand Compliance
Ensure all UI follows brand guidelines:
- **Colors:** Primary Yellow (#F7D774), Deep Green (#2E5E4E), Charcoal Gray (#2D2D2D)
- **Typography:** Inter primary, Poppins secondary
- **UI Elements:** Rounded cards (16-20px), pill buttons, minimal line icons

### Documentation Plan
- API documentation updates (OpenAPI)
- Component documentation with examples
- Data dictionary changes
- User guide updates

**Don't make any code edits, just generate comprehensive plans that align with Moo Climate's technical standards and business goals.**
